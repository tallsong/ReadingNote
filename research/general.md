## APPROACHING A PROPOSAL
- get advice from funding agency. In the case of [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org), there is a “Guide to EPSRC Research Grants”. 
    - You must, must, must write your proposal for their benefit.
    - you have one minute or less to grab your reader’s attention.
    - Ask lots of people to help you improve your proposal.
        - If they misunderstand what you were trying to say, don’t say “you misunderstood me”; instead rewrite it.

- Evidence of industrial interest in a proposal, and of its potential for future exploitation will usually count in its favour. 

## COMMON SHORTCOMINGS

- substantiate your goals with solid evidence of why you have a good chance of achieving them
    - “We have an idea”. In this case, you should sketch the idea, and describe preliminary work you have done which shows that it is indeed a good idea. 
    - “We have a good track record”. Include a selective list of publications, and perhaps include a short paper (preferably a published one) which gives more background, as an appendi
